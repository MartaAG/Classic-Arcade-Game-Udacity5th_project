# Classic-Arcade-Game-Udacity5th_project
A project for Udacity FEND Nanodegree

Here is a classic Arcade Game, a fifth project for Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree.

## How to run the game?
If you want to play locally on your computer, download the game or clone the repository. Then right-click on the HTML file, and open the game in your favourite browser.
## How to play the game?
Move your player and aim to the river. Three bugs are constantly running across the way, avoid meeting them. If the collision happens, the game resets. Every time your player aim the goal, it will change its appearance.

### Materials
All the components of the game are given by Udacity. I updated the app.js so the game could work.
